*To start from: pip install -r requirements.txt*

In order to use the program, you will need to turn on the API. To turn it on, just use the command: uvicorn API:app --reload

Then just start gui.py or no_gui.py.
Just give the command: python3 gui.py or no_gui.py

I could have done it without the API itself, because it uses an existing one, but I wanted to practice :)

# UPDATE: If you don't want to use API.py, run no_api.py
